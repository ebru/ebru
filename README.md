                "It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. 
                I want to know what you ache for and
                if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing.
                
                It doesn’t interest me how old you are.
                I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool 
                for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive."
